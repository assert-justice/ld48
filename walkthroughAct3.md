# Act 3 Walkthrough

This act consists of a series of rooms. You can explore the rooms freely but ultimately you are trying to answer Horse Wizard's riddle. You can find the answer yourself in Jane's cubicle but you don't have to.

You start in a hallway. Pick the option that moves ahead to the locker room. H.W. Will accost you. The answer to his question is GNU (case insensitive).
